# 📸 BlackBox Studio

> A full-stack photography studio web application for showcasing portfolios, managing bookings, and handling client inquiries — built with React + Vite on the frontend and Flask on the backend.



---

## 🌟 Overview

BlackBox Studio is a modern photography studio website that serves as both a client-facing portfolio platform and a business tool. It features an animated gallery, service package listings, a booking system, and a contact form — all backed by a Python/Flask REST API with MongoDB and email notification support.
